- Exceptional expected return.
- Benchmark portfolios.
- Definition of active management value-added.
- Total risk and return vs. active risk and return.
- Benchmark timing vs. stock selection decisions.

## New terminology
$$\beta_n = \frac {Cov(r_n, r_B)} {Var(r_B)} \ (4.1)$$

- $r_B$ is the excess return on the benchmark portfolio
- $r_n$ is excess return on stock n
- Beta is no longer an absolute term. It is not beta with respect to the market, but beta with respect to a benchmark.

$$\pmb h_{PA} = \pmb h_P - \pmb h_B \ (4.2)$$
$$ Active cash=\pmb h_P(0) - \pmb h_B(0) = - \pmb e \cdot \pmb h_{PA} \$$

- $\pmb h_{PA}$ is the active holding in the risky asset.

$$\psi_P^2 = \pmb h_{PA}^T \cdot \pmb V \cdot \pmb h_{PA} = \sigma_P^2 + \sigma_B^2 - 2 \cdot \sigma_{P,B} \ (4.4)$$

$$\psi_P^2 = \beta_{PA}^2 \cdot \sigma_B^2 + \omega_P^2 \ (4.5)$$
